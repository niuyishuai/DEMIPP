## Synthetic dataset 
The coefficients of polynomials are integers randomly chosen in the interval [-10,10], and the decision variable ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V\in\{-1,1\}^n) with ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2\leq n\leq 10) for small-scale cases and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?11\leq n\leq 20) for relatively large-scale cases. The degree of polynomials d is chosen in the interval [2,6] which covers the most frequently used polynomials in real-world applications. 

## Benchmark dataset MQLib
This dataset consists of 3296 large-scale, heterogeneous Max-Cut and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, combining real-world problem instances and random problem instances from multiple random generators. Both of them are quadratic Boolean programs. This dataset can be found in Dunning, Gupta and Silberholz [1]
